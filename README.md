# Description

This project is built by using React and Tailwind CSS. I used rechart library to show charts in this project. In this project, users can create a product by adding the required information. First users have to write the project name, contractor, client, and description. After writing all the information user can upload a CSV file or can write manually the information as well. If the user uploads the CSV file he/she will see a chart. After uploading the CSV file he/she can see the result by clicking the See Result button. If he/she clicks the button will redirect to the result page. Here he/she can see all the information he written on the form. Here he/she can download the result table by clicking the download button. If he/she clicks the download button will have a Result.pdf file downloaded.

In this project, all the data given by the user is stored on the browser localStorage. So that I can show the data to the user on the result page.
